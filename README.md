# Linear-Regression-and-Logistic-Regression-on-an-Unknown-Dataset

This is my individual programming assignment 1 of COMP4211 Machine Learning in HKUST.

This programming assignment involves data exploration, data preprocessing, linear regression, logistic regression and performance enhancement.

You should see the following things:

* code_(Part 1).ipynb: the data exploration part
* code_(Part 2).ipynb: the data preprocessing part
* code_(Part 3).ipynb: the linear regression part
* code_(Part 4).ipynb: the logistic regression part
* code_(Part 5).ipynb: the performance enhancement part
* code.zip: a zip file contains all the above 5 Jupyter Notebook
* code: a folder which is extracted from code.zip
* data.zip: a zip file contains the training dataset and the testing dataset
* data: a folder which is extracted from data.zip
* pa1.pdf: the instruction for this programming assignment
* report.pdf: the report for this programming assignment

## How to run?

1. Download and put all the files to the same folder in Google Colaboratory
2. Adjust the file paths inside the Jupyter Notebook if necessary
3. Run all the codes
